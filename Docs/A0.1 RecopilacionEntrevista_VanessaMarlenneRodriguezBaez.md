# customer Journey

We chose this tool because it is more visual to see each part of the project and it was more adapted to our needs, as we know the experience map details in a visual and schematic way the project. It is easier to imagine each step of the process, it is based on 3 phases: what do you do, what do you think and what do you feel.

3.  Prepare and expose your document, considering doing the dynamics as you would do a job in the field or client site, and present it to the advisor and your classmates.

## conclusions
___
- **Renteria Sanchez Hector Ivan:** During the performance of this work we had problems when formulating the questions in a way in which the necessary information was obtained from the client, as a team we were able to correct some questions and we began to make the experience map based on the information obtained, In this phase we had some confusion to make the map due to the way in which to write it, exchanging ideas we reached a middle ground so that the phases of the map were understood, personally I think that the ideas that each team member had were scattered at the beginning, but by exchanging each one of them we managed to better understand the activity.
- **Rodríguez Báez Vanessa Marlenne:** During the development of this practice we touched on the topic of desing thinking which with the use of its tools we managed to reach a result on the information of the 15 questions we did as a team on our case study, we did not have a very clear idea of the case but once with the answers we knew well what to do, when selecting the tool we had a problem because we did not choose the one that best suited our case and we had problems, once we used the experience map tool (customer Journey) it made it much easier to continue with the activity and understand the desing thinking.

- **Soria Márquez Guillermo:**
- **Villanueva Mercado Daniel Alejandro:** The use of tools is a somewhat complicated issue, since you must first analyze which tools are best suited to the case study you are analyzing. The problem comes when you choose one and at a certain point you realize that many aspects are repeated in that tool, as we realized when using the What, How and Why tools, since in the Why part we realized that many things could be repeated in meaning even if the context was different, so after reanalyzing the tools we used the user experience tool, which turned out to be better adapted to what we had in mind.
