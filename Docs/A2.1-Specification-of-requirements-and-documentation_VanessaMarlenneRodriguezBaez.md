## :trophy: A2.1 Learning Activity

- Documentación de especificación de requisitos y el Estándar IEEE830

### :blue_book:  Instructions

- Based on the documentation of the ERS IEEE830 Standard and the template provided by the consultant, elaborate the filling of all the points referred in this document for the case study.
 - All activity or challenge must be done using the **MarkDown style with .md** extension and the VSCode development environment, or you can use any platform such as **Notion**, and must be prepared as a **single page** document, that is, if the document has images, links or any external document must be accessed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A2.1_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf.**.
- It is required that the .MD contains a tag of the link to the repository of your document in GITHUB, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the conclusion of the challenge it should be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** file that should be uploaded to classroom within its corresponding section, serving as evidence of your delivery, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the qualification of your activity.
- Considering that the .PDF file, which was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
- Your repository, in addition to having a **readme**.md file in its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor data, and even logo or images, must have a contents section or index, which are actually links or **links to your .md** documents, _avoid using text_ to indicate internal or external links.
- We propose a structure as indicated below, but you can use any other structure that will help you to organize your repository.

## Conclusions 

*  **Renteria Sanchez Hector Ivan:**  
  
*  **Rodríguez Báez Vanessa Marlenne:**  In this activity we combined what was previously seen in the tasks, this task helped us as a team to be more organized and know more about the documentation that is carried in a project, no matter if it is school or already in the workplace, our setback was that many times we did not know what that section meant or what it really took only with research and see examples we came to the conclusion of how to do it, thanks to these works we realize that it is not just programming, it is a process of documents and points to achieve a successful work.
