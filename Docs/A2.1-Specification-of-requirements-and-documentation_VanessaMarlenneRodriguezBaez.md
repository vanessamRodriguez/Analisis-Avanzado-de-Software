# Introduction

## :trophy: A2.1 Learning Activity

- Documentación de especificación de requisitos y el Estándar IEEE830

### :blue_book:  Instructions

- Based on the documentation of the ERS IEEE830 Standard and the template provided by the consultant, elaborate the filling of all the points referred in this document for the case study.
 - All activity or challenge must be done using the **MarkDown style with .md** extension and the VSCode development environment, or you can use any platform such as **Notion**, and must be prepared as a **single page** document, that is, if the document has images, links or any external document must be accessed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A2.1_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf.**.
- It is required that the .MD contains a tag of the link to the repository of your document in GITHUB, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the conclusion of the challenge it should be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** file that should be uploaded to classroom within its corresponding section, serving as evidence of your delivery, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the qualification of your activity.
- Considering that the .PDF file, which was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
- Your repository, in addition to having a **readme**.md file in its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor data, and even logo or images, must have a contents section or index, which are actually links or **links to your .md** documents, _avoid using text_ to indicate internal or external links.
- We propose a structure as indicated below, but you can use any other structure that will help you to organize your repository.

## Conclusions 

*  **Renteria Sanchez Hector Ivan:** In this work, the documentation of the work that we have carried out during these last weeks was carried out, as a team we managed to better understand the points requested in the template provided by the advisor, personally the point that was difficult for me was that of user requirements Since it was difficult for me to understand the difference between the functional requirements of the system and those of the user because they were similar in several parts, researching I was able to better understand how to write them in order to complete my part of the activity.
  
*  **Rodríguez Báez Vanessa Marlenne:**  In this activity we combined what was previously seen in the tasks, this task helped us as a team to be more organized and know more about the documentation that is carried in a project, no matter if it is school or already in the workplace, our setback was that many times we did not know what that section meant or what it really took only with research and see examples we came to the conclusion of how to do it, thanks to these works we realize that it is not just programming, it is a process of documents and points to achieve a successful work.
  
*  **Soria Márquez Guillermo:** I had previously made a document on the structure, whether physical or logical, of a software, but this document on Specifications of software requirements.
The only doubt that arose at the time of writing this document was about the software interface and the user interface, I did not understand well what the difference was, after investigating I was able to differentiate each requirement. Personally I think that this documentation is more focused to more technical topics about software.

*  **Villanueva Mercado Daniel Alejandro:** The document looked like it would be difficult to make, but it didn't take me long to see that it was easy to make it, since most of the things that the document asked for were already done. The only thing that we had to think about more clearly were the necessary points in which certain issues of the document and the program were described, but more than anything else, we had to elaborate those parts in a way that they were understood in a very clear way. By elaborating this document we can visualize issues that were probably not contemplated and therefore had to be discussed to make sure that everything said in the document was in line with reality.
