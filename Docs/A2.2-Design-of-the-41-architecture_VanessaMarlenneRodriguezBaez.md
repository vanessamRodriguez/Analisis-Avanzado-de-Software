# Introduction

## :trophy: A2.2 Learning activity

- Documentation of system architecture based on 4+1 model

### :blue_book: Instructions

 - Based on the documentation provided by the consultant, develop diagrams that can be used to design the 4+1 model-based system architecture for the case study.
 - All activity or challenge must be done using the **MarkDown style with .md** extension and the VSCode development environment, or you can use any platform for example **Notion**, and it must be elaborated as a **single page** document, that is to say if the document has images, links or any external document it must be accessed from tags and links, and it must be named with the nomenclature **A2.2_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf.**.
- It is required that the .MD contains a tag of the link to the repository of your document in GITHUB, for example **Link to my GitHub** and at the conclusion of the challenge it should be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** file that should be uploaded to classroom within its corresponding section, serving as evidence of your delivery, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the qualification of your activity.
- Considering that the .PDF file, which was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
- Your repository, in addition to having a **readme**.md file in its root directory, with information such as student data, work team, subject, career, advisor data, and even logo or images, must have a contents section or index, which are actually links or **links to your .md** documents, _avoid using text_ to indicate internal or external links.
- We propose a structure such as this one indicated below, however you can use any other that supports you to organize your repository.
