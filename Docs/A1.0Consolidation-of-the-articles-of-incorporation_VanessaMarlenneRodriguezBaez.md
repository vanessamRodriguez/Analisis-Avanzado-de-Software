- Every activity or challenge must be done using the **MarkDown style with .md** extension and the VSCode development environment, and must be elaborated as a **single page** document, that is to say, if the document has images, links or any external document it must be accessed from tags and links.
- It is required that the .md file contains a link tag to the repository of your document on Github, for example **Link to my GitHub**.
- At the end of the challenge the created .md file must be uploaded to github.
- From the **.md** file a **.pdf** file with the **A1 nomenclature must be exported0_NombredelaActividad_NombreAlumno.pdf**, which must be uploaded to the classroom in its corresponding section, to serve as evidence of its delivery; being this **official** platform, here you will receive the grade of your individual activity.

## conclusions 

*  **Renteria Sanchez Hector Ivan:** For this work, each point of all the work that we did individually for activity 1.2 had to be analyzed, thus we complemented the information and we managed to better understand the issues in which we had doubts, the part that complicated us the most as a team was the restrictions. After discussing it together, we corrected this point and wrote the restrictions that we consider correct.
  
*  **Rodríguez Báez Vanessa Marlenne:** Based on practice C1. 2 of the constitutive act that each one made, several sections of each one were taken in order to achieve a good constitutive act, we held a meeting among all and the documents were presented and thus be able to put the best information, our problem was to reach a agreement between all to be able to put the information since each one has a different point of view, with this practice we were able to better prepare a Constitutive Act as well as know what parts it contains, how to detail the importance of the project as well as understand what the client wants in the creation of it.
  
*  **Soria Márquez Guillermo:** At the time of creating the charter I had to investigate what each concept referred to because it was not clear to me what information was needed. I had some problems with the milestones because I did not understand the definition but in the end I ended up putting a date on the development of the software, I also modified the prices because at the beginning I considered that it was a very low cost. One of the points that complicated me the most were the assumptions because I did not understand what it referred to but after the teacher's explanation it was clearer. Other than those points I had no problem. In previous subjects I had already made a constitutive act but the truth is that I forgot some concepts, this practice helped me to reinforce them and to have more clear how it should be developed.

*  **Villanueva Mercado Daniel Alejandro:** In this activity, which is based on activity C1.2 that asked us to elaborate a project charter individually, but in this one all team members are required to participate by giving their point of view on each of the points of the charter. In this way, by discussing each of the points and giving our opinion, we were able to elaborate the document in the best way. Although there were some points in the document where we were a little lost, since we do not know if what we were putting was right.
